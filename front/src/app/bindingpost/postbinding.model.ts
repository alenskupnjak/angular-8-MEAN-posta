// INTERFACE is a specification that identifies a related set of properties and methods to be implemented by a class. In other words, a given class agrees to support this specification when it implements that interface. The interface is simply the definition of the properties and methods, and the class that implements that interface has the actual code for each of those defined properties and methods. In Typescript, you can use the interface itself as a data type. Interfaces in Typescript are a development time only concept, they are not included in the final JavaScript after the build process.
